      <h2 id='download-header'>What is Desk<span class='highlighted-t download-header'>App</span> ?</h2>
      
      <p class='download-desc'>DeskApp is a sideproject that i'm currently working on for fun. Its a hobby project and currently is a piece of software that works on OSX and Windows 10.
          DeskApp is a mulit-purpose utility running on your computer. It has many features that are under development and others thsat are only in plnning.
          Since it is developed by myself only, I have limited capabilities of development and features. Currently I plan on developing it until its no longer worth it.

      </p>

      <p class='download-desc'>The current released build is version <span class='highlighted-t'>1.0.1</span> To view all previous builds and patch notes please visit the projects <a href='https://github.com/tylerbadger23/' class='highlighted-t'>Github</a>.

      <h2 id='features-dw-header'>Development & Build Status</h2>
      <p class='download-desc'>The current build is not considered to be stable. Major and fatal bugs are still being discovered and I am 
        aware that bugs exist. This application is considered in a beta build and it is likely that the user will encounter some crashes, 
        or bugs while using it. 
        
        This application is mostly stable on Windows x64 machines but on OSX it is mildly unstable at times. If you would like to support 
        my development by providing feedback on bugs and crashed I would appreciate it.

    <p class='download-desc'>My name is Tyler Laceby and I'm currently developing this for my own enjoyment and practice.
        I am studying Computer Science and I see this project a another good learning oppurtunity and practice for getting getter at Nodejs development.
          I am very confortable in Nodejs and PHP, and Python. I also have spent time learning C# and Unity Engine.
